# Description
PANGDUINO:
Concept:
We created a small Arduino game where the Arduino handles all the game logic, including the movement of the bouncing object and the timing of the jumps.

The goal of the game is simple:
we have to move our hand over the ultrasonic sensor at the right moment to keep the object bouncing.
If our timing is correct, the object continues bouncing.
If we move too early or too late, the bounce fails and the game ends.

As the game progresses, the bouncing speed gradually increases, making the timing more challenging.
Our score is the number of successful bounces we achieve before the game ends.

It’s a fast and fun reaction game that tests precision and timing, with the Arduino controlling the logic, the ultrasonic sensor detecting our actions, and the phone screen displaying the game.
